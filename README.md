# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Description

Using the concepts I have learnt to complete a real-world situation in which I create code for analyzing the financial records of a company. 

## Usage

Navigate to the 'inspect' section of the browser, I like to do this by right-clicking anywhere on the page and scrolling down to select it. 
</li>

 Select 'Console' in the navigation bar.
</li>

</ul>
